## <a name="the-data"></a> :page_facing_up: The Data

### <a name="a-game-of-sorts"></a> A Game Of Sorts

The data that were used for the fine-tuning and evaluation of our approach came from the collaborative image ranking task "[A Game Of Sorts](https://github.com/willemsenbram/a-game-of-sorts)".
For information about this task, we refer the reader to the "[Collecting Visually-Grounded Dialogue with A Game Of Sorts](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.242/)" paper.


In order to reproduce our work and make effective use of our annotations, you will need the "[A Game Of Sorts](https://github.com/willemsenbram/a-game-of-sorts)" data:

```
git clone https://github.com/willemsenbram/a-game-of-sorts.git
```


In order to download the images, in the `./a-game-of-sorts/dataset/` directory, run:
```
bash get_images.sh
```
The images will be downloaded to `./a-game-of-sorts/dataset/images`.


### <a name="our-annotations"></a> Our Annotations

Span-based mention annotations aligned with the images they denote can be found in the `./annotations/data` directory.

The referent descriptions from the various sources as discussed in the paper, including the manually constructed "ground truth" labels that have been used for fine-tuning and evaluation, can be found in the `./descriptions/data` directory.

The supplementary material (`supplementary_material.pdf`) covers additional details about our human evaluation as well as hyperparameters used for model fine-tuning.
